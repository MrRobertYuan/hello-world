# hello-world
A repository for testing

## Introduction for Myself
My name is Robert, and I just started to learn how to use git-hub
I am in Peking University, and I major in Computer Science.
But this is the first time i try to use git-hub!
I think git-hub looks amazing! And it's a pity for me not trying to use it before!

Now I am testing the Latex is supported in this markdown or not:
$m = ec^2$
